# Hey there, I'm Arben Apura! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of GitHub. I'm a Filipino Programmer currently diving into the world of Full-stack Web Development while pursuing my BSIT at Bulacan State University - Sarmiento Campus. I enjoy tinkering with modern tech stacks like SvelteKit, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS to build cool stuff on the web.

Feel free to explore what I'm up to, and let's connect if you're into web dev too!
